# Service Management Implementation

## Summary of Changes

     - Service Image (with camera/gallery selection)
     - Category Selection
     - Service Settings (staff assignment, popularity, max bookings, buffer times)
     - Tags for service

3. **API Integration:**
   - Fully integrated with the backend API through `enhanced_service_management_service.dart`

## Integration with Service Management

The Add Service screen is accessible from the Services tab and integrates with the full service management workflow:

1. Services tab displays all services with filtering and sorting options
2. Users can add new services through the floating action button
3. After a service is created, the services list refreshes automatically
4. Services can be viewed, edited, or deleted through the service detail screen

This implementation completes the service management feature of the application with a production-ready solution.
