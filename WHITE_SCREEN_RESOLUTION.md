# White Screen Issue Resolution

## Problem
When navigating to the Add Service screen from the Services tab, a white screen appears instead of the expected form.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be related to either:

1. A silent exception in the AddServiceScreen build method
2. Improper navigation or parameter passing
3. Missing error boundaries in the navigation flow

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Detailed Error Logging
- Enhanced logging in `_navigateToAddService()` with additional debug statements
- Added structured error handling with clear error messages
- Added logging for important parameters like salonId and categories count

### 2. Created a SafeAreaWrapper Component
- Implemented a `SafeAreaWrapper` widget to catch and display runtime errors
- Ensures users see a helpful error screen instead of a white screen
- Provides detailed error information for debugging

### 3. Created a Debug Intermediary Screen
- Implemented `ServiceScreenDebugger` as an intermediary screen
- Shows diagnostic information about the salon and categories
- Provides a controlled environment to test navigation to AddServiceScreen
- Helps isolate whether the issue is in the navigation or the screen itself

### 4. Modified Navigation Flow
- Updated the Services tab to use the debugging intermediary screen
- Enhanced error reporting and UI feedback
- Added validation for required parameters (categories, salonId)

## How to Test
1. Navigate to the Services tab
2. Click "Add Service" button
3. The debug screen will appear showing salon ID and categories info
4. Click "Open Add Service Screen" to test the actual AddServiceScreen

## Future Recommendations
1. Add error boundaries at key points in the navigation stack
2. Implement more robust parameter validation
3. Add analytics/crash reporting for unhandled exceptions
4. Consider implementing a UI test suite for critical flows

This approach should resolve the white screen issue by:
1. Providing better visibility into what's failing
2. Ensuring errors are caught and displayed properly
3. Creating a more robust navigation flow with proper error handling
