# Registration Error Flow Fix

## Issue Identified
The registration screen was showing success SnackBar notifications and navigating to the email verification screen even when registration failed due to errors.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `_onRegisterSuccess` method in `auth_wrapper_screen.dart`. The original logic was:

```dart
void _onRegisterSuccess(RegistrationResult? registrationResult) {
  if (registrationResult != null && !registrationResult.isEmailVerified) {
    // Email verification required
    _navigateToEmailVerification(registrationResult.email!, registrationResult.password);
  } else {
    // Email already verified, proceed to app
    widget.onAuthSuccess();
  }
}
```

**Problem**: When `registrationResult` was `null` (indicating a registration error), the `else` clause was being executed, calling `widget.onAuthSuccess()` which navigated away from the registration screen.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Auth Wrapper Logic (`auth_wrapper_screen.dart`)
```dart
void _onRegisterSuccess(RegistrationResult? registrationResult) {
  if (registrationResult != null) {
    // Registration was successful
    if (!registrationResult.isEmailVerified) {
      // Email verification required
      _navigateToEmailVerification(registrationResult.email!, registrationResult.password);
    } else {
      // Email already verified, proceed to app
      widget.onAuthSuccess();
    }
  }
  // If registrationResult is null, do nothing - stay on registration screen
  // This allows the error to be displayed and form data to be preserved
}
```

**Key Change**: Wrapped the entire logic in `if (registrationResult != null)` check, so when registration fails (returns null), no navigation occurs.

### 2. Enhanced Register Screen Error Handling (`register_screen.dart`)
- Added debug logging to track when registration fails
- Removed unnecessary SnackBar error display (errors are already shown in the UI via Provider)
- Ensured that `onRegisterSuccess` is only called when `registrationResult != null`

### 3. Added Debug Logging (`auth_provider.dart`)
- Added debug print when errors are set to help track the error flow
- This helps confirm that errors are being properly caught and set

## Current Flow

### Successful Registration
1. User fills form and submits
2. AuthProvider.register() returns RegistrationResult
3. Register screen shows success SnackBar
4. Calls `onRegisterSuccess(registrationResult)`
5. Auth wrapper navigates to email verification or dashboard

### Failed Registration
1. User fills form and submits  
2. AuthProvider.register() catches error, sets error message, returns null
3. Register screen detects null result
4. Register screen stays on current screen (no navigation)
5. Error is displayed via Provider error state in UI
6. Form data is preserved automatically
7. User can correct error and try again

## Testing the Fix
To test that the fix works:

1. **Try to register with existing email** - should stay on registration screen and show error
2. **Try to register with invalid data** - should stay on registration screen and show error  
3. **Try to register with valid data** - should show success and navigate to verification
4. **Check form preservation** - form fields should retain values when errors occur

## Key Behaviors Ensured

✅ **Stay on Screen**: Registration errors keep user on registration screen  
✅ **Preserve Form Data**: All entered information is retained during errors  
✅ **Clear Error Display**: Errors shown prominently in UI  
✅ **Real-time Error Clearing**: Errors disappear when user starts making corrections  
✅ **No Unwanted Navigation**: Only successful registrations trigger navigation  
✅ **Proper Success Flow**: Valid registrations still work as expected
