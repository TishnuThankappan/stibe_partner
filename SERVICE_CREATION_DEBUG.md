# Service Creation Debugging Guide

## Issue: "Add Service feature coming soon" message

The user reported seeing a "coming soon" message when trying to add services. After investigation, this could be due to several reasons:

### 1. Wrong Screen Being Used
There are multiple service screens in the codebase:
- `enhanced_services_screen.dart` - ✅ **Fully functional** (this is the correct one)
- `services_tab_content.dart` - ❌ **Stubbed with "coming soon"** messages
- `redesigned_services_screen.dart` - ❌ **Has some "coming soon"** features

**Solution**: Ensure navigation is pointing to `EnhancedServicesScreen`, not `ServicesTabContent`.

### 2. API Server Not Running
The API server might not be running on `http://10.52.70.23:5074/api`.

**To check**:
1. Verify the API server is running
2. Check the console logs for API errors
3. Test the endpoint manually: `POST /api/salon/{salonId}/service`

### 3. Authentication Issues
The user might not be authenticated or have the wrong permissions.

**Error messages to look for**:
- "Authentication failed. Please log in again."
- "You don't have permission to create services for this salon."

### 4. Network Connectivity
The device might not be able to reach the API server.

**To test**: Check if other API calls (like getting salons) work.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
Updated `enhanced_service_management_service.dart` with better error handling:
- More specific error messages for different HTTP status codes
- Better debugging output
- Clearer error reporting to the user

### Improved Template Screen
Updated `service_templates_screen.dart` with:
- Better error handling and logging
- Navigation back to services list on success
- More detailed error messages

### Debugging Output
Added console logging to track:
- Service creation requests
- API responses
- Error details

## Testing Steps

1. **Verify correct screen is used**: Check that navigation goes to `EnhancedServicesScreen`
2. **Check API server**: Ensure the backend is running
3. **Test authentication**: Verify user is logged in
4. **Check network**: Ensure device can reach the API
5. **Monitor console**: Look for debug output during service creation

## Files Modified

1. `lib/api/enhanced_service_management_service.dart` - Enhanced error handling
2. `lib/screens/services/service_templates_screen.dart` - Better debugging and error reporting
3. `SERVICE_CREATION_DEBUG.md` - This documentation

If the issue persists, check the console output for specific error messages and verify which screen is being used.
